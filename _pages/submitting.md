### A more open process

As with the previous edition of the Blog Post track, we forgo the requirement for total anonymity. 
The blog posts **must be anonymized for the review process**, but users will submit their anonymized blog posts via a pull request to the blog track's repository (in addition to a submission on OpenReview).
The pull request will trigger an automated pipeline that will build and deploy your post onto a website dedicated to the reviewing process.
